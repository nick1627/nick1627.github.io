            <h2>Delays</h2>
            <p>You might have noticed delays when plotting with large n.  To plot, first the 
                coordinates of the objects are calculated, and then they are plotted via
                plotly.react().  The second part takes ~100 times longer than the first, and
                I have no control over it.  The only solution is to seek a better plotting
                library.
            </p>
			<h2>Other problems that need fixing</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Fix delays - stop replotting if input has updated again</li>
